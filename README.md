snel
==============================================================================

`snel` is the [lightweight](http://idlewords.com/talks/website_obesity.htm) 
template and a static website generator that I use for my personal website. It 
is currently a work-in-progress, but it is mostly functional. It roughly 
consists of three parts, each of which, I hope, may prove useful to someone:

1.  A simple makefile, to create documents and other resources.

2.  A Python script to generate a table of contents directly from the 
    directory structure.

3.  A logo and a minimalist style to present the above.


To install `snel`, do `make install`. To then use it with your own project, 
simply create a `Makefile` with the following lines:

    SRC=/path/to/sources
    DEST=/path/to/build
    USER=ftp_username
    HOST=ftp_host
    REMOTE=ftp_directory
    include snel.mk

Executing `make` will then generate a `build/` directory containing scripts, 
stylesheets and the example website. Should this be a bit primitive for your 
tastes, try other static website generators such as [hugo](http://gohugo.io/), 
[hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/about.html),
[jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), [nanoc](https://nanoc.ws/), 
[yst](https://github.com/jgm/yst) or [middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/).



Makefile
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Plain text formats like [Markdown](http://commonmark.org/help/) and 
[YAML](http://www.yaml.org/spec/) are lightweight, understandable, and 
modifiable. I glued a couple of 
[standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy) tools into a 
[make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make)-recipe for website generation.

Using `pandoc`, it creates an HTML file for every Markdown document it can 
`find` in the source directory. Upon running `make` a second time, any 
resource referenced in the source file metadata will also be generated. Given 
an appropriate configuration, the results are uploaded with `lftp` by calling 
`make upload`.

As of now, the recipe calls for [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/) 2.x with 
[pandoc-citeproc](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc-citeproc),
[Panflute](https://github.com/sergiocorreia/panflute),
[Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.x,
[sass](http://sass-lang.com/),
[svgo](https://github.com/svg/svgo),
[ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/),
[jp2a](https://csl.name/jp2a/),
[lftp](http://lftp.yar.ru/) and
[find](https://www.gnu.org/software/findutils/) â€” but you could easily 
substitute or add any ingredient.

Index
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The directory hierarchy is useful for much the same reason that plain text is 
useful. The `index.py` script generates a site-wide table of contents directly 
from the folder structure.


Style
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The theme is kept simple and monochrome. Its most distinguishing quality is 
that the table of contents extends horizontally and that all its entries are 
visible without further tapping, hovering or sliding; it is supposed to act as 
a vantage point. The CSS is written using `lessc` and minified with 
`clean-css`. The filters are made with `panflute`.
